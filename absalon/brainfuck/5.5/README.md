# Euler Problem01 in Brainfuck

## Compiler
To install brainfuck compiler, simply run `sudo apt-get install bf` if in ubuntu. If not, I don't care, it's your problem not mine. This was hard enough for me, I don't want to have to solve anything else related to this. Thank you for your understanding

## Run
Simply run either `clean.bf` or `commented.bf` by passing them to the compiler as a parameter:  
```
bf clean.bf
```
