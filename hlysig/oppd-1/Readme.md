# Solution to the first problem from OPPD.

Solution to the first OPPD (One problem per day) at Azazo. This is the first problem in the Euler problem set.

This source code depends on Check (Unit Testing Framework for C).
To install on Ubuntu/Debian:

    sudo apt-get install check

or using Homebrew

    brew install check


# Compile and run!
To compile the solution

    ./setup.sh

to run:

    build/foo -l 1000

The `-l` parameter is for setting the limit for the problem.
To run the tests, apply the `-t` parameter on the application.
